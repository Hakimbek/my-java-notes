# Java Comments
The Java comments are the statements in a program that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter.

### Why do we use comments in a code?
- Comments are used to make the program more readable by adding the details of the code.
- It makes easy to maintain the code and to find the errors easily.
- The comments can be used to provide information or explanation about the variable, method, class, or any statement.
- It can also be used to prevent the execution of program code while testing the alternative code.

### Types of Java Comments
There are three types of comments in Java.

- Single Line Comment
- Multi Line Comment
- Documentation Comment

## Java Single Line Comment
The single-line comment is used to comment only one line of the code. It is the widely used and easiest way of commenting the statements.

Single line comments starts with two forward slashes (//). Any text in front of // is not executed by Java.

## Java Multi Line Comment
The multi-line comment is used to comment multiple lines of code. It can be used to explain a complex code snippet or to comment multiple lines of code at a time (as it will be difficult to use single-line comments there).

Multi-line comments are placed between /* and */. Any text between /* and */ is not executed by Java.
