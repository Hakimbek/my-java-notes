# Simple, Object Oriented, and Familiar
***Primary[^1]*** characteristics of the Java programming language include a simple language that can be programmed without ***extensive[^2]*** programmer training while being ***attuned[^3]*** to current software practices. The fundamental concepts of Java technology are ***grasped[^4]*** quickly; programmers can be productive from the very beginning.

The Java programming language is designed to be object oriented ***from the ground up[^5]***. Object technology has finally found its way into the programming ***mainstream[^6]*** after a ***gestation period[^7]*** of thirty years. The needs of distributed, client-server based systems ***coincide[^8]*** with the encapsulated, message-passing paradigms of object-based software. To function within increasingly complex, network-based environments, programming systems must adopt object-oriented concepts. Java technology provides a clean and efficient object-based development platform.

Programmers using the Java programming language can access ***existing[^9]*** libraries of tested objects that provide functionality ranging from basic data types through I/O and network interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits. These libraries can be extended to provide new behavior.

***Even though[^10]*** C++ was rejected as an implementation language, keeping the Java programming language looking like C++ as far as possible results in it being a familiar language, while removing the unnecessary complexities of C++. Having the Java programming language ***retain[^11]*** many of the object-oriented features and the "look and feel" of C++ means that programmers can migrate easily to the Java platform and be productive quickly.
