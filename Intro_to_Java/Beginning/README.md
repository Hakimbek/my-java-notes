# About the Java Technology
Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.

## The Java Programming Language
The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:

- Simple
- Object oriented
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic
- Architecture neutral
- Portable
- High performance
- Robust
- Secure

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the `.java` extension. Those source files are then compiled into `.class` files by the *javac* compiler. A `.class` file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine. The *java* launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
