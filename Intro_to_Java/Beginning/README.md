# About the Java Technology
Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.

## The Java Programming Language
The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:

- Simple
- Object oriented
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic
- Architecture neutral
- Portable
- High performance
- Robust
- Secure

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the `.java` extension. Those source files are then compiled into `.class` files by the *javac* compiler. A `.class` file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes — the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine. The *java* launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

Because the Java VM is available on many different operating systems, the same `.class` files are capable of running on Microsoft Windows, the Solaris™ Operating System (Solaris OS), Linux, or Mac OS.

## The Java Platform
A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. We've already mentioned some of the most popular platforms like Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris OS, and Mac OS. Most platforms can be described as a combination of the operating system and underlying hardware. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in that it's a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.

The Java platform has two components:

- The Java Virtual Machine
- The Java Application Programming Interface (API)

You've already been introduced to the Java Virtual Machine; it's the base for the Java platform and is ported onto various hardware-based platforms.

The API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities. It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as packages.

As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code. However, advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability.
