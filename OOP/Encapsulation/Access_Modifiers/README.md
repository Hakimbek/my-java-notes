# Access Modifiers in Java
There are two types of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.

The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it.

## There are four types of Java access modifiers:

# Private
The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

### Role of Private Constructor
  - If you make any class constructor private, you cannot create the instance of that class from outside the class. 

### Note
  - A class cannot be private or protected except nested class.
