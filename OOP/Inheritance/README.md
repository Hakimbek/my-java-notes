# Inheritance
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

## Why use inheritance in java
  - For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
  - For Code Reusability.

The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality. In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or superclass, and the new class is called child or subclass.

## Types of inheritance in java

### 1. Single Inheritance Example
  When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.

### 2. Multilevel Inheritance Example
  When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.

### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance Example
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.

## Note
   - Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.
   - In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.
