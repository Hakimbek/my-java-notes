# Iterator in Java
In Java, an Iterator is one of the Java cursors. Java Iterator is an interface that is practiced in order to iterate over a collection of Java object components entirety one by one. It is free to use in the Java programming language since the Java 1.2 Collection framework. It belongs to java.util package.

## Advantages of Java Iterator
Iterator in Java became very prevalent due to its numerous advantages. The advantages of Java Iterator are given as follows -

- The user can apply these iterators to any of the classes of the Collection framework.
- In Java Iterator, we can use both of the read and remove operations.
- If a user is working with a for loop, they cannot modernize(add/remove) the Collection, whereas, if they use the Java Iterator, they can simply update the Collection.
- The Java Iterator is considered the Universal Cursor for the Collection API.
- The method names in the Java Iterator are very easy and are very simple to use.

## Disadvantages of Java Iterator
Despite the numerous advantages, the Java Iterator has various disadvantages also. The disadvantages of the Java Iterator are given below -

- The Java Iterator only preserves the iteration in the forward direction. In simple words, the Java Iterator is a uni-directional Iterator.
- The replacement and extension of a new component are not approved by the Java Iterator.
- In CRUD Operations, the Java Iterator does not hold the various operations like CREATE and UPDATE.
- In comparison with the Spliterator, Java Iterator does not support traversing elements in the parallel pattern which implies that Java Iterator supports only Sequential iteration.
- In comparison with the Spliterator, Java Iterator does not support more reliable execution to traverse the bulk volume of data.

## Java Iterator Methods
The following figure perfectly displays the class diagram of the Java Iterator interface. It contains a total of four methods that are:

- hasNext()
- next()
- remove()
- forEachRemaining()
